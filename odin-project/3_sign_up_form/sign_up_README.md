  * Create Account Button bg-color: #596D48
  * Inputs:
    * The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), 
      * but we’ve included 2 variations. 
        * For starters, the password inputs should be given an `error` class.
        * The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class you’ve learned about in an earlier lesson.
        
* Tips:
  * The area behind the “ODIN” logo is a div that has a dark, but semi-transparent background color. This enhances the readability of the text against the busy background image.
  * Do not worry about making your project look nice on mobile
  * Checking that the password fields match each other requires javascript. Try to implement this if you feel confident, otherwise just validate each field separately.
